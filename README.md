//reflect on project upon completion
  The purpose of this project was to re-create the google home-page to the best of our ability.  I found it to be quite the challenge despite the deceptively simple layout that google portrays. At many points through the project I needed to go back and relearn certain concepts, especially with divs and flexbox and how to use css to control them.  I demonstrated my ability to organize and style elements in various locations through the webpage, used flexbox to make elements responsive to browser size, at least I think. I also demonstrated the ability to add hover effects to elements using css.  Overall incredible eye opening experience from start to finish!
